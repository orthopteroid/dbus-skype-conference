dbus-skype-conference
=====================

perl skype app showing how to use dbus in linux to dial a conference call.

This is an old plugin that may not work with any newer version of skype.

It was useful to me at the time my limited cell plan  had unlimited incoming minutes: from anywhere in town I could email (via sms gateway) to my computer to initiate a conference call between my cell and any other number.

:D
