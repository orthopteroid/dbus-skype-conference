dbus-skype-conference
=====================

perl skype app showing how to use dbus in linux to dial a conference call.

This is an old plugin that may not work with any newer version of skype.

It was useful to me at the time the minutes on my cell plan were limited outgoing but unlimited incoming.

From my cell I could email (via sms gateway) to my computer to initiate a conference call between my cell and any other number.

:D
